# Disease Prediction Toolkit

## Overview
A beginner-friendly toolkit to build, evaluate, and demo machine learning models for disease prediction using real-world datasets (e.g., Heart Disease UCI, Pima Diabetes). The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest), evaluation, and visualization suitable for healthcare AI/ML portfolios.

## Contents
- notebooks/demo_colab.ipynb — end-to-end notebook for Colab
- scripts/ — modular scripts for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction
- tests/ — basic tests
- presentation/ — 5-slide summary
- visualizations/ — output figures

## Usage (quick start)
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Place dataset CSV in data/ or link from Kaggle
4. Run the notebook notebooks/demo_colab.ipynb in Google Colab
5. Train models: python -m scripts.train_models (or follow notebook)

## Dataset: Diabetes dataset

## Deliverables
- Notebook, scripts, evaluation plots, demo video (30s), and 5-slide presentation.
